                    Veronica (also spelled Veronika or Verónica) is a female given name, the Latin transliteration of the Greek name Berenice, Βερενίκη, [1] which in turn is derived from the Macedonian form of the Athenian Φερενίκη, Phereníkē, or Φερονίκη, Pheroníkē, from φέρειν, phérein, to bring, and νίκη, níkê, "victory", i.e. "she who brings victory".

                <p>      
                    The Ancient Macedonian form of the name was popularized because of its extensive use as a royal feminine name by the reigning dynasties of the states of the Diadochi of Alexander the Great throughout the Eastern Mediterranean during the Hellenistic age, most notably by the Ptolemies of Egypt and by the Seleucids of the Levant. In medieval etymology, Veronica was sometimes supposed to derive from Latin vera (true) and Greek eikon (image).[4]

                    Its popularity in medieval and modern times is based mainly on the importance in Christianity of Saint Veronica and her Veil of Veronica. Pet forms of Veronica include Ronnie and Roni and the German Vroni. In Russian, the pet form is Nika (Ника). "Veronica" is a popular name in many countries in the Mediterranean, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, and also Ireland, France, and French-speaking Canada.
